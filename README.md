# Gregtrip
This addon for <a href="https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech-Modern"></a> adds the famous psychedelic LSD as well as its chemical synthesis from various precursors loosely based on real life chemical processes.

It also adds a bunch of extra chemicals to the game that are used in the synthesis.
